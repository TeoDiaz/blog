# What is console.log("Hello World")?

If you know it, you can skip this paragraph!

It is the beginning for anyone who wants to know how a computer works... in most free courses, and I have started many, the first thing they teach you is how to say "Hello World" in a computer "console"...

Why? Well, it's the same reason why we start learning how to write with the letter "A"... someone came up with saying "hello" to the world for the first time. Cool, right?

I took free courses to try to understand my friends when they talked about websites, servers, and such... I was the one who didn't understand anything and just nodded. The free courses didn't work. I was still just as ignorant, knowing only how to say "Hello World" in a browser console... and that's it. All my friends had taken a route and I chose another one due to a perspective error, which I'll explain now.

_I'm going to start againâ€¦_

In my blog, I come to talk to you about my time at Ironhack.

But first, the day everything changed, everything that preceded my entry through the doors of Ironhack as a student.

I'm going to bore you a little with my story, I'll be brief, I swear! But it's necessary to demonstrate that one step can change your life.

I start by saying:

It's not easy to leave your job, but when you have shifts of 10/12/14 hours... no body can handle that. I had a job in a bad sector, I made a bad move, yes, but I liked it, I even put so much effort into doing it well that I was promoted shortly after, to a position of trust with 50 people around me who expected me to be their guide. Yeah, it sounds nice, but when you're paid peanuts and they expect 10 times more from you than when you were just watching the street, it becomes very heavy and you stop enjoying it.

I "was" a security guard (low-skilled employee), so they could do that.

Since I was a child, I had the same saying:
-What do you want to be when you grow up?
-Anything but sitting in a chair.

Actually, I was telling it wrong, because after my almost 6 years in the army and then 5 years as a security guard, I discovered that I couldn't be more wrong. I didn't want a job where I would stand for 10 hours, I wanted to work in a job that I liked, feel proud of learning, be able to go further every day and then have time to do my "Spartan Race", weekends in the countryside with the family... in short, not to be standing still, but working in a chair doesn't have to be a "still" job. I would discover that much later.

Now I think about it and it wasn't a mistake, but an experience,dare a way to live something that you either live at 20 or the opportunity is gone. I was a paratrooper in the Spanish Army, they call it the "elite". Yes, I like to think back to those days when we got together with 50 others to jump from a "Hercules" plane. But that wouldn't take me anywhere. There was a shortage of training, time to study something new, and I couldn't settle for what I had, I wanted more.

All my friends were studying, learning, and developing themselves, while I was jumping out of airplanes.
What crazy things we do when we're young! Hahaha. Now they talk to me about their futures and I didn't know what to do with mine.

So, with my low qualifications and the future in my hands, I ended up walking through the doors of Ironhack.

I tell this story to show that I started with a knowledge base of 0.0.

In my next post, I'll explain the exact moment when I left everything behind for a challenge!
