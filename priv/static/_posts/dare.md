# To improve, you have to dare.

There is a phrase that I recently heard and that haunts me wherever I go.

"Behind every great man, there is always a great woman who is not valued."

Why?

When Fleming discovered penicillin, he reduced mortality rates to incredible levels for that time.

Thank you, Mr. Fleming.

But does anyone know who Sarah Marion is?

His wife.

That lady who prepared his food, did the laundry, and went to the market while he spent hours and hours researching... Her sacrifice was never rewarded.

And this leads me to... there are not one but two great women behind my life change.

My wife, who made me change my mind, supports me every step of the way, and on top of that, after the countless hours I spend studying at Ironhack, she works when she can in her small business, takes care of our child, and is pregnant with our next daughter! Even I am amazed... Does anyone doubt that she is a great woman? Besides, I owe it to her to be who I am and where I am.

And the second woman is a former Ironhack student whom I was so proud of when I heard about her days at Ironhack, her life change, her frustrations (I'll tell you more about this later), etc...

And there she was, sitting on my couch and "I'm not telling you, I'm doing it" (as the great Goyo says), I transcribe the conversation, almost literally:

One day at my house:

Me: ...I can't take it anymore, they changed my shift three times today, took away 20 hours from me this month, on top of that, I work many nights, I don't know...

My friend: Give me your computer.

Me: (poker face) ... for?

My friend: I'm going to sign you up for Ironhack, at least let them call you, it's time to leave that shit... (can you say shit in a blog, right?)

And that's how it happened, she took my laptop, opened it, typed a few things, and between the two women who were in the living room that day, they convinced me that I had to leave my exploitative job and exchange it for a decent life.

Taking the step to go on unemployment, taking the few savings and the help of family members... that was a challenge.

Here, really, everything began.
